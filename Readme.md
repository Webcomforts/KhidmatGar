Khidmatgar - A Website for Civic Engagement doing Community Service



Why KHIDMATGAR ?

In todays world where access to internet is taken for granted and the web has become a free marketplace for merchants,
a free library for learners with access to a zillion resources of information and most of all the endless opportunities 
to meet and connect with people; we have now become acustomed to free resources and solutions for our different needs. so
one way or the other we are helping oursleves for our own needs, that is to say looking for best possible solutiosn for 
our own difficulties or problems.

But what about the problems and difficulties that exist in our community, our locality or neighborhood. How do we address  
them being a preveliged citizen, preveliged because we have better access of information, the internet of people we know
who can solve or perhaps reach them. This scenario gives rise to two basic questions (1) How & where does one go about 
delivering his problem on the internet ? Facebook or tiwtter are too social and informal to do this, neither is there
any formal government website where people can post there problem. (2) Someone who want's to volunteer for there community
work, specially univesity or college students , or someone with a career or profession wants to use his exptertise or
experience been used for a noble cause, a life-saving problem or a cause.

This is where Khidmatgar fills the void, Khidmatgar is an online civic engagement website where problems are posted and people 
follow and discuss for possible solutions. Community Problems can be divided into categories and hence user can also choose 
from a filterd list he is interested to solve. Like a person with a civic deploma can help in construction of a school for the
poor as a noble cause.
